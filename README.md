## Data Decription (as available on Kaggle)
### Context
Motivated by Gregory Smith's web scrape of VGChartz [Video Games Sales](https://www.kaggle.com/gregorut/datasets), this data set simply extends the number of variables with another web scrape from [Metacritic](http://www.metacritic.com/browse/games/release-date/available). Unfortunately, there are missing observations as Metacritic only covers a subset of the platforms. Also, a game may not have all the observations of the additional variables discussed below. Complete cases are ~ 6,900
